#Custom SASS Framework

This is a repo for my own custom flexible framework for use on my personal projects.

The plan is to use [Susy](https://github.com/oddbird/susy) for my grid system, [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) for my reset and then rely on NPM or Bower packages for any additional plugins I may need.

Currently I'm in the process of developing my breakpoint and visibility classes with sass.
